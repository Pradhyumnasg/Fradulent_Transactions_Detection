# Fradulent_Transactions_Detection
This repository contains code and resources for detecting fraudulent transactions. The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a given dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain the dataset from [insert source or provide instructions on how to acquire the dataset]. Once you have obtained the dataset, place it in the data directory. The dataset should be in a CSV format with the following columns:

transaction_id: Unique identifier for each transaction.
amount: The amount of the transaction.
merchant_id: The identifier for the merchant involved in the transaction.
customer_id: The identifier for the customer involved in the transaction.
timestamp: The timestamp of the transaction.
label: The label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not fraudulent (0).
Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraudulent-transactions.git
cd fraudulent-transactions

Usage:

Make sure you have the dataset in the correct format 

Results
The evaluation script will output various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the model. The results can be found in the console output.
